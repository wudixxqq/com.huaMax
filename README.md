**XposedFakeLocation** is an Android application and Xposed module that allows you to spoof your device's location globally or for specific apps without using "mock location" from the developer options. Customize your location with precision, including sensor data, and add randomization within a specified radius for enhanced privacy.

## **Features**

- **Global or Per-App Location Spoofing**: Override your device's location data system-wide or on a per-app basis.
- **Custom Coordinates**: Set precise GPS latitude and longitude coordinates.
- **Fine-Tuned Spoofing Settings**: Customize other custom sensor values such as speed, speed accuracy, vertical accuracy, mean sea level, mean sea level accuracy, GPS noise, etc.
- **Randomization**: Set a radius for location randomization to mimic real-world movement patterns.
- **Intuitive UI Navigation**: Easy access to maps, favorite locations, and settings.
- **Per-App Templates**: Define reusable location profiles (coordinates + setting overrides) and assign different templates to different target apps simultaneously.

---

## **Prerequisites**

- **Rooted Android Device**: The app requires root access to function properly.
- **Minimum Android Version**: 11 (API 30)
- **Xposed Framework**: Install the `Xposed Framework` compatible with your Android version. It is recommended to use [LSPosed](https://github.com/LSPosed/LSPosed) as it is the most popular `Xposed Framework` manager app.

---

## **Installation**

You can always install the latest stable version of `XposedFakeLocation` from the [releases](https://github.com/noobexon1/XposedFakeLocation/releases) page. 

If you want to build by yourself:

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/noobexon1/XposedFakeLocation.git
   ```

2. **Build the Application**

   - Open the project in `Android Studio`.
   - Build the APK using `Build > Build Bundle(s) / APK(s) > Build APK(s)`.
   - Alternatively, use `Gradle`:

     ```shell
     ./gradlew assembleDebug
     ```

3. **Install the APK**

   - Install the APK via `adb`:
   
     ```shell
     adb install app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
     ```

4. **Activate the Xposed Module**

   - Open `LSPosed Manager`.
   - Enable the `XposedFakeLocation` module.
   - In `LSPosed` scope settings, select `Android System Framework ('android')` and `Phone Services ('com.android.phone')`.
   - Reboot your device to apply the scope change.
   - Select target apps directly inside `XposedFakeLocation` instead of selecting each target app in LSPosed.

   **Alternative (pre-v0.0.7 behavior):** If the in-app target selector does not work for you, open `Settings` inside `XposedFakeLocation` and turn `"Use built-in target app selection"` OFF. In that mode the in-app list is ignored and the `android` / `com.android.phone` system-wide hooks are skipped at boot. You then pick target apps directly in the `LSPosed` manager app (just like in v0.0.6) — add each target app to the module's scope there, remove `android` and `com.android.phone` if you no longer need them. Reboot your device to apply the scope change.

## **Usage**

1. **Launch the App**

   - Open `XposedFakeLocation` from your apps menu.

2. **Navigate the Interface**

   - Use the navigation menu to access different sections:
     - **Map**: Primary interface for location selection
     - **Favorites**: Saved locations for quick access
     - **Target Apps**: Apps that should receive spoofed locations.
     - **Templates**: Concurrently spoof multiple apps with different locations and settings at the same time using templates.
     - **Settings**: Configure application behavior
     - **About**: View application information

3. **Select Target Apps**

   - Open `Target Apps` from the navigation menu.
   - Search for and select the apps that should receive spoofed locations.
   - Apps not selected here will keep receiving their normal location data.

4. **Select a Location**

   - Use the integrated map to select your desired location by tapping on the map.

5. **Configure Settings**

   - Optionally, access the `Settings` screen to fine-tune your spoofing settings.

6. **Start Spoofing**

   - Toggle the `Play/Stop` button to begin location spoofing.
   - `XposedFakeLocation` will override location data only for apps selected in `Target Apps`.
   - If the target app was already running, it should be force stopped and reopened to apply the spoofing.

7. **Stop Spoofing**

   - Toggle the `Play/Stop` button to cease location spoofing.

8. **Headless Mode (Optional. Off by default)**
   - Drive the module from another app or `adb shell` via broadcast intents — start/stop and update coordinates without opening the UI. See [`docs/EXTERNAL_CONTROL.md`](docs/EXTERNAL_CONTROL.md) for more details.
