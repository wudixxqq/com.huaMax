Release APK output:

```text
app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
```

## Signing

Local release signing is configured through `keystore.properties`, which is intentionally ignored by Git.

Keep a private backup of these local files:

```text
keystore/locationmax-release.jks
keystore.properties
```

Do not upload signing certificates, keystore passwords, activation private keys, server passwords, or tokens to GitHub.

## External Control

Broadcast actions use the LocationMax package prefix:

- `com.huaMax.action.START`
- `com.huaMax.action.STOP`
- `com.huaMax.action.SET_LOCATION`

See [docs/EXTERNAL_CONTROL.md](docs/EXTERNAL_CONTROL.md) for examples.

## Remote Control

The app can read a JSON control file to support global enable, disable, and force-update states. See [docs/PUBLISHING.md](docs/PUBLISHING.md) before publishing, because the public APK should point to a server path you control.

## Publishing

GitHub and LSPosed publishing notes are in [docs/PUBLISHING.md](docs/PUBLISHING.md).
